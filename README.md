# Tesla Homepage clone.

This project was bootstrapped with [Astro](https://astro.build/), using JavaScript and [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/). Along with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for deployment.

Its unique features such as the menu system or the vertical slider were implemented, also the background video in the first section and images for the rest of the sections. In addition, the header changes its colour depending on the section and a hover effect has been added in the menu with a dark background that follows the mouse.

## ðŸš€ How did I create this project?

This project is one of the many projects carried out through the Frontend development online courses carried out by Midudev (Miguel Angel DurÃ¡n). In this case, the project was built using Astro. Astro is a framework that works with any library and is designed for speed.
The easiest way to create an App React like this, is by creating a basic React template but adding Redux to the template.

- [x] First, use the following command in the terminal. Its Installation Guide has full, step-by-step instructions for installing Astro using its CLI wizard.

```bash
npm create astro@latest
```

- [x] Then, go to your project and open it in your code editor, if you are using Visual Studio Code (VSC) you can run the following command in the terminal.

```bash
code .
```

- [x] If using Visual Studio Code, install the extension for Astro. This will create a more visual and pleasant development environment.

- [x] Now, open the terminal in Visual Studio Code and install Tailwindcss for the styles. Tailwind CSS is an open source CSS framework for faster and easier design of web pages and applications. The main feature of this library is that, unlike others like Bootstrap, it does not generate a series of predefined classes for elements.

```bash
npx astro add tailwind
```

The advantage you have when using Astro is that the installations are easier. Using the above command you no longer have to worry about the settings because Astro does it for you.

- [x] Also, install the extension for Tailwind css in Visual Studio Code, this way you will have auto-completed available while you write the classes.

- [x] Finally, start the project up. Run the following command in the terminal to fire up your web in the development mode. This should automatically open up on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view your initial web in your browser.

```bash
npm run dev
```

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
